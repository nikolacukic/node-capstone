# About

This is a capstone project for the course "Node.js for front-end developers"

It covers some basic concepts in node.js like:
- Interacting with a lightweight database like [sqlite](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)
- Creating a simple API using [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

## Testing

To run the project locally run `node server.js` from the root of the project.
In order to test, it is recommended to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and send requests to `http://localhost:3000` using JSON format in the request body.
